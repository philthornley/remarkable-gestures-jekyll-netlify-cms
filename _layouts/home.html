Hello, I’m Phil Thornley, a Product Manager & Experience Designer based in Manchester.
</p>

<h2>A few things about me...</h2>

<p>Since 2015, I’ve worked for ThoughtWorks, a global software consultancy, working with large enterprises to create great customer experiences that deliver business value.</p>

<p>I specialise in <a href="#">Service Design</a> and <a href="#">User Research</a>. I’m also an experienced <a href="#">Agile</a> practitioner and coach.</p>

<p>Before ThoughtWorks, I spent 8 years at the Co-op doing UX.</p>

<h2>Things I believe in</h2>

<h3>Agile</h3>

<p>I prefer Agile over Waterfall; to be truly succeed, teams cannot be agile in silo and I actively promote agile in all organisational levels.</p>

<h3>Data & ‘Value’ led</h3>

<p>Whilst some ‘gut feel’ initiatives work, I prefer to start with Data, Research & realistic measurements / KPI’s.</p>

<h3>My rule of thumb for prioritisation</h3>

<p>Use Business strategy to choose Target customers, use their Goals and activities to choose Features and content last. Always Minimise output, maximise outcome and impact. </p>

<h3>Collaborative & Co-designing sessions</h3>

<p>Bringing together different parts of the business brings new perspectives & ideas.</p>

<h3>Sharing</h3>

<p>My tactic is to work out loud and over communicate (Proved very successful in my current role). I advocate a truly open door policy. Workshops over meetings - My favourite - When talented people are one room, something good should come out of it, not actions for later. </p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

<p>It’s not a nice-to-have: it’s a standard. I’m proud that the Co-op was the first national high street brand to achieve the RNIB’s Surf Right standard.</p>

<h3>Prototyping & early feedback</h3>

<p>Experiencing an idea helps you refine it. I’d rather spend a day creating a testable paper, clickable jpeg, or HTML & CSS prototype than 4-6 weeks building the finished idea without any feedback</p>

<h3>User testing</h3>

<p>Most designs launch without being user tested. Not mine. MVT & A/B testing - Test, learn, iterate & improve in quick succession. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
