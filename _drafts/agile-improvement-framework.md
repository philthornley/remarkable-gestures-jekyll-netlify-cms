##Description
The Agile Improvement Framework can help agile teams discuss, assess, visualise and plan changes to their way of working - it aims to prompt conversation about where teams could next focus and how they might go about it.

It is essentially 4 categories of agile behaviours and practices. Behaviours and practices are segmented within each category based on 4 team maturity progressions.

It has been put together by agile coaches based on their experiences with teams ranging from agile beginners to agile experts, both inside and outside of Shop Direct.



##Goal
To help teams, capabilities and individuals discuss, assess, visualise and plan around focused areas of improvement.

###When to use
Teams, capabilities and individuals can use the framework whenever they choose, however we recommend you formally revisit it every 3-4 months to see how you have moved.

###Teams
When teams are stuck in a rut and wanting to see a change in their outcomes, the framework provides a foundation for assessment and suggestions
When teams want to work on a particular area e.g. planning  - take a slice of the framework
When teams want to be more exploratory and objectively assess new areas to work on and improve

###Capabilities
Capabilities can read through the framework, mark out the aspects that are relevant to them and then explore them in turn to identify gaps and feed into their development plans

###Individuals
Use the framework to form your own personal development plan
Reference the framework to build your understanding of the practices and behaviours that agile teams ideally exhibit / explore other roles and capabilities


###Suggested team exercise
Materials you'll need
Note - there are many ways of preping this exercise, we'll cover two methods

###Exploratory method 1 (read and write from the framework doc)
Printed copies of the framework (one each or one shared by every pair)
Post-its
Pens
Large Post-its or Index cards with the headings...
We're realising the value of this & we're doing it all the time (What next?)
We should do more of this...
Continue to focus
It's helped, lets do more
We need to be more consistent
We see value in this. We should start/trial this
We see the value in this but this is not a focus or we're constrained
This is getting in the way (NOTE: Sometimes teams need to stop doing stuff inorder to do other things)
We don't see the value / don't understand the value of this (NOTE: We don't need to agree with the framework, challenge and question it but be clear as to why)
Actions - Stuff we'll do
(Optional) Large screen, laptop and connection cable to display the digital version of the framework.
Exploratory method 2 (Printed statements)
Same as above, however you have printed each statement separately (either all statements or a slice of statements you intend to discuss) so that they can be handed out.

This version requires more prep but will speed up the discussion.



##Preparation
Propose and agree its use with your team/capability
Schedule a team session - we suggest 1.5 hours as a minimum. (Consider scheduling followup sessions)
Find a room with a large wall and consider finding a more informal space.
Share the framework (or slice) for pre-reading
Prep materials for the team session, choosing which method you'll use.
Stick the headings on the wall (suitably spaced out, more so than the example below)




##How to run the session
###The setup
Introduce the session objectives - We're going to discuss, assess, visualise and plan around areas of improvement - we'll use the framework as a guide to prompt conversation about where we could next focus and how we might go about it.

Provide an overview of the framework with the team if they've not been introduced to it

Run through the headings and explore what they mean to get shared understanding. Advise that we'll place statements under each heading to help us organise where we are and what we'll focus on next.

Depending on the setup method you choose, introduce how you'll talk about the framework content

Exploratory method 1 - methodically go through top to bottom the statements you have selected (or all) and discuss in turn, writing the statement on a Post-it and placing it under a heading.
Exploratory method 2 - Hand out the individual printed statements, distributed at random to each team member, ask them to place them under the heading they choose and then discuss.
Exploratory method 2.1 - Building on method 2, instead of printing the statements, you could ask your team members to write out the statements on Post-its for a sheet or two (distribute the the sheets evenly across the team) before asking them to place them under the heading they choose and then discuss.
Both Exploratory method 2 and 2.1 shortcut the activity a bit so that you can quickly focus in on the headings, starting with 'We're realising the value of this & we're doing it all the time' (moving right to left across the headings)

###The discussion
The value in this exercise is all in the discussion. Do we understand it? Do we value it? Are we really doing it? Should we try it? Should we continue doing it? What could it mean? How would we go about doing it? (Note: if it's not imediately obvious, don't dwell on the possible solutions too much - keep it as a next step to explore and select)

Make sure to explore the subtly in the language.  We've found that at first glance teams can miss this, and when we slow down and explore it, they have started to question themselves and a really good conversation and assessment has come about. 

Know when to move on. 

If you identify any actions, add them under the Actions heading as you're going along.

###Prioritise
The headings are there to help you organise and to a greater or lesser extent, prioritise next steps. 

Aim to spend the final 20 minutes of the session to prioritise which areas you want to focus on. You can't do everything! Be selective and focused. For example, you may have lots of things in 'We should do more of this...' and  'We see value in this. We should start/trial this' but should you focus on embedding the stuff you should do more of first or will you balance them and focus on a mix.

The aim is to be selective. You can always add more once you feel you've moved the needle in the right way.

At the end of the session, take photos and record the final state. Ensure that you have some next steps. Next time you come back to this activity in 3 months time, see how you have moved. Have you progressed? Has anything regressed? This happens too! Where do you want to go next?
