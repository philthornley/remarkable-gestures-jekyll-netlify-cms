This exercise gets a group of people to size (based on different criteria i.e. physical size or complexity etc) a bunch of animals or fruit from Extra Small (XS) to Extra Large (XL)

## Goal
This exercise is designed to allow participants to experience and reflect on how as a group they size / scale work relative to each other. It's a mock of a story sizing exercise.

## Learning Objective
It's not as easy as it looks. Talking to each other helps to understand the sizing attributes they will concentrate on. E.g are all the animals babies, is the size based on height from the floor and they are all standing up, how complex are the fruits to eat?  do the grapes have pips in, how are they presented etc.
By talking to each other they can agree on the attributes and size as a team removing ambiguity
How does this apply to your stories and sizing estimates


##Material
6 cards with sizes XS, S, M, L, XL and Don't know (?)
Approximately 8 (or more) cards with different Animals names or Fruit names. Ensure one (or more) of the animals is something that it is unlikely that people have heard of e.g.Quetzal. You could also have a spare set of more animals/fruit to throw in later to see if their scale changes.
Example Animals 
Blue Whale
Cat
Rhino
Sheep
Dog
Elephant
Tiger
Quetzal
Axolotl
Water bear (Micro-animal)
Example Fruits
Coconut
Banana
Clementine
Melon
Pineapple
Grape
Apple
Jackfruit
Preparation
If you have a large group divide them up into teams of 5 people
Lay the size cards on the table from smallest to largest with Don't know (?) at the end
Have the animal/fruit cards stacked to the side


## How to run the exercise
Get the teams to stand in front of their tables with the size cards laid out in the following order XS, S, M, L, XL and Don't know (?) - You could increase the scale from XXS to XXL or Infinity (∞) if you want a wider scale.
Ask them to take the stack of Animal/Fruit cards and sort them from Extra Small to Extra Large
For Animals, you could be open on the sizing criteria (i.e. get them to agree what size means)
For Fruit, give them the criteria of complexity to eat it
Tell them to use Don't know (?) for the things they can't decide or need more information on.
Give them 3 minutes to do this.
Listen to the conversations
Interject with opposing views and add complexity - i.e. What if the customer does not like seeds in the grapes and wants them sliced? What if they don't like the pith on the clementine and they want each segment completely smooth? What do you need to do with the outer skin? Where will you dispose of it? What you're trying to do is get them to explore and discuss the scope, agreeing on a common view point. Things can get complex if we allow them to and it's positive to explicitly expose, include or exclude scope.


## Debrief
Ask what happened during the game?
Did you find this easy?
Animals
How did you agree on what “size” means - i.e. what attribute did you use - height, weight, mass, volume or something else - it doesn’t really matter as long as it was consistent and everyone agreed on what it was?
Fruit
Did you talk about the customer needs - i.e. they don't like seeds and the grapes, clementines etc could have these. Did this change the scale?
Did you find any dependencies - we'd need a knife and spoon to slice it and scoop out the seeds?
How did you resolve disagreements on size?
Did you know what all of the animals/fruits were? If you placed it on the ‘?’ this is a signal to do a spike or go and find out more about the value, objective and scope.
From an agile story perspective, if you placed a story in Medium or above, this should trigger the question ‘Can we break this down?’. The bigger a story is, the more risky it is.
Think about the Pinapple, often this deemed as complex, in the Large to X-large category. We could break down the Pinapple into a few stories 1) top and tail it 2) remove the outer skin 3) Slice the flesh into portions (whether to cube or large round slice it would effect the complexity) - these may now feel smaller in complexity now they're broken down. Also sequence, it may be easier to remove the outer skin if you play this first and can use the top (leaves) to hold and stablise it on the chopping board. Also, you have now identified a dependency, you need a knife and maybe a chopping board, where will you source this from, do you have the funds?
Think about the Melon, also often this deemed as complex, in the Large to X-large category. We could break down the Melon into a few stories 1) Halve it 2) remove the seeds 3) Slice the flesh into portions (whether to cube or large slice it with the skin on would effect the complexity) - these may now feel smaller in complexity now they're broken down. We have now identified a few dependencies, you may need a spoon, knife and maybe a chopping board, where will you source this from, do you have the funds?
Where do the above broken down stories now sit in the relative scale? Is halving a Melon more complex or less complex or just as complex than our Clementine story (no skin, pith and remove seeds)
The big ask(s)
Ask the team to commit to sizing their own stories / backlog relative to each other
Ask them to attach any assumptions they have made during sizing to the story - so we know why we sized in this way.
Ask them to then break down any stories that are Medium and above
Ask them to act on anything that is unknown - i.e. plan a spike etc, go and clarify the scope etc.
Ask them to assess and size stories they've already played on the same scale - defining examples of 'Extra small', 'Small' etc
Ask them to bring the examples to every estimation session they have from now on so they have a consistent reference - it's easier to do relative sizing against known stuff.


## Different relative scales
There are a number of different scales you can use to do your relative sizing...

T-Shirt sizes - XS, S, M, L, XL - You could increase the scale from XXS to XXL or Infinity (∞) if you want a wider scale.
Fibonacci e.g. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 etc
A scale where each sizes is double the preceding - e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 etc
Always have a 'Don't know / No idea' option so the team don't 'just put it somewhere'

T-shirt sizes can be converted to a number scale for story points e.g. XS = 1, S = 2, M = 4 etc

It doesn't matter what system you use, as long as you're consistent and they mean the same thing to the team.


Agile Values & Principles
Shared understanding
Working as a team
Collaboration
Talking to each other
Things could appear to be small but complex to deliver
