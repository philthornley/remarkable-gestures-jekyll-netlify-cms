What
The concept of the ThoughtWorks 'Inception' was first developed by Luke Barrett in 2004 as he'd formed a view on what made a great kickoff for teams and projects.

It is...

Tried and tested way to kick off product development
Time boxed - In most instances 2-3 weeks, sometimes longer but less frequently shorter (I might as well state this up front, there is a danger in rushing/squeezing an inception into a shorter timescale, if you do this you may pay with more stressed, less engaged teams, quality will drop and you will find that activities will spill out into the following weeks anyway!). Less than 2 weeks may be appropriate when you have a well established team tackling a small initiative/problem statement (strong amount of context already in team and complexity is low).
Based around a tightly formed and well bounded problem statement and scope (if you don't have this going in, you are not ready for an inception, do a discovery first)
Highly visual - decisions and information exist as physical artefacts
Highly collaborative (although you need to be somewhat exclusive to make it focused)
Feedback driven and adaptive - We pivot and adapt our agenda based on what we find out
Focused on "Just enough" to get started - after all we will learn more by doing
It is not...

Upfront analysis
A discovery - make this a very separate activity/phase that happens before the inception.
The only way to kick off new work (But it does work)


Objectives of an inception
The two high level objectives on an inception are to a) Create alignment and a shared understanding within the team and organisation and b) Evaluate and establish the approach and core prosesses the team will take to solve the problem statement/meet the initiative goals.

Lets break this down a bit...

Create alignment and a shared understanding
Form the initial team
Align around a common vision (linked to the organisation direction)
Objectives and measures of success
Explore and define the initial scope (and what's not in scope)
Prioritised high level requirements
Evaluate and establish the approach and core prosesses
Evaluate Key risks, issues and constraints
Define tech approach (v1)
Define Test strategy (v1)
Define the release plan (v1)
Agree Ways of working


Ultimately leading to 'Enough to get started' and confirming the greenlight to secure funding for the investment needed (now we have a better idea of what that is)

Note: Some inceptions result in a positive decision to not proceed with investment - that's a good thing, you've saved time and effort.



A note on the Pre Inception Discovery phase
A discovery is not part of an Inception. It's the phase before the Inception where you will...

Bring together a small subset of a team to collectively explore the problem stage
Create / Validate the business model - is this a viable problem to fix? What could it's world look like (Customer proposition, Revenue & cost streams, Support / activity dependencies etc)
Draft the vision
Define and refine the boundaries / scope
Gather research and MI (Managed Information)
Stakeholder interviews - understand alignment and remove miss-alignment 
Identify the core team needs/skills and match to potential members
Identify supporters and collaborators
Establish stakeholder map and who makes what decision


All the above leads to the critical question...

Have we go a tightly formed and well bounded problem statement and scope?
Yes? Now go forth and plan the inception
No? You're not ready to go into the inception phase


Outputs and Deliverables from an inception
Essential
Vision - whilst usually created before the Inception, you'll have explored it and aligned to it during inception. You may choose to build a elevator pitch etc or do an activity to visualise it in the inception.
Measures of success - Similar to the Vision, you'll have a good idea of what success looks like going into the inception and test, challenge, align and refine it. One output of the inception may be to work out how to tangiably validate data against it.
Tradeoffs - stack ranked list of what you will flex on - Budget, time, scope, quality etc?
Prioritised list of the 'things' that deliver the most value
Release plan (everything and could get more high level the further out it gets)
Detailed plan for the 1st early and meaningful release of value
Non Functional / Cross functional requirements (Prioritised using MOSCOW)
In / Out scope list
RAID log - Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies - Including decisions / next actions for the top ones (most urgent/impactful)
Stakeholder map and Commications plan
Logical scope - Users, Impacts and dependencies on systems and applications (New/Exisiting/3rd party)
Tech approach (Including visualisation of the Tech To Be Architecture)
Test plan
Path to production - how we'll get stuff live continuously
Team principles and Ways of Working (including ceremonies and cadence etc)


Contextual / Optional
Here's just a starter (there are many more depending on the tightly formed and well bounded problem statement and scope)

Selection principles - the objective tests of how we score and select a viable solution
Roles and Goals - prioritised matrix of the potential users (including internal users and stakeholders) and their ranked goals, needs and wants
User journey map
Design mockups / prototypes
Roles and Responsibilities *
Agile understanding *
and many more....
* A strong learning from experience is to do these activities in advance of the Inception so that your attendees are completely absorbed in the 'here and now' activity and are not distracted by their personal circumstances and worries about their future role and ways of working.
