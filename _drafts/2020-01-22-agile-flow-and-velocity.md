A core aim of any agile team is to deliver continuously at a sustainable pace. A consistent and manageable flow means that bottlenecks are removed, we're more predictable (we know how long it will take to deliver xyz) and the team will not be burned out.

When we look at our flow, we should aim to optimise the whole. We should look at the whole system, not just one small part, and how it all links together.

For example, if we're struggling with the flow through QA to QA done, the answer is not to double the number of people playing the QA role. We may look further up the flow to understand how we're thinking about the quality from the beginning, increasing efforts earlier in the flow may improve the flow later on through QA to QA done.

We should also consider the size of the work we are progressing through the flow, the smaller the size, the quicker it will flow and the more consistent and predictable our overall flow will be. The bigger a story is, the more risky it is.

Use these exercises to explore these concepts...

Also consider using this exercise as a way to approach sizing and breaking down stories...
