User Stories
DISCLAIMER

There is no one or perfect way of writing stories. We should always adapt our approach to the team rather than adapting the team to our approach. Every team needs to find out what suits their project needs best.



What is a story?
A tool for iterative development
Unit of work that should be developed
Help track a piece of functionality lifecycle
Placeholder for a conversation
Shared understanding
Three C’s (Card – Conversation – Confirmation)
What a story is not
An arbitrary container for tasks
A breakdown of work by technical convenience/specialty
A specification of the solution
A contract - it should be always negotiable
INVEST in your user stories
Make them...

I Independent

N Negotiable

V Valuable

E Estimable

S Small

T Testable

Sometimes it is not possible/useful to use all the criteria at once but always strive for Valuable, Small, Testable.


Common ingredients of a story
Summary - sentence to describe that the story is prefixed with the device
Description - the information in this field is built up as the team learn more about the story.
Business Value - As a...I want...so that
Summary - some background information about the story
Scope - list of what is in scope e.g. brands this is on, device, any technical information in terms of feature toggles, 
Out of scope - what is not required as part of this story
Assumptions/Questions - list any assumptions or questions that may need to be resolved
Impact - any other things that need to be considered that may impact the user story
Dependancies - these could be other stories that need to be delivered first 
NFRs - secuirty, perforamance impacts
Design - the link to inVision where the designs are


Note - you may not need al of this information for every story - tailor it to the needs of the story and don't get distracted trying to fill gaps that are not important (to that story)



Acceptance Criteria
What is it?  Acceptance critea ios defines the boundries of a user story, the acceptance criteria should be used to ensure the story is completed and working as intended.

The nature of Acceptance Criteria
To elaborate stories
Corroborate (support) stories
Are described by the business - normally during the development phase (when a commitment has been made to prioritise the story)
Are a set of conditions that the story must meet for it to be accepted as complete
Acceptance criteria does not replace the conversation they are one of the results of the conversation
Are abstractions of what business value will be observed
Are not tests - although tests are concrete examples of acceptance criteria
Provide the boundary conditions for tests
Qualities of effective Acceptance Criteria
S - SPECIFIC - Explicitly defined and definite

M - MEASURABLE - Possible to observe and quantify

A - ACHIEVABLE - Capable of existing or taking place

R - RELEVANT - Having a connection with the story

T - TIME-BOUND - When will the outcome be observed

Writing Acceptance Criteria
Should be created with the customer in mind
Should be created with or discussed with someone technical in the room
Ask is what we are discussing technically possible?
Ask what the customer will observe when the story is successfully complete
Ask more than one person for their understanding
Ensure everyone understands (including PO who accepts A/Cs) that all must be met before the story can be accepted
Considerations:
Environment/Conditions/Context
Actor(s) involved
Verb/Actions
Observable result
Watch out for
Ambiguous language
Subjective/Judgemental language (Better, Good, Allowable)
Generalisations (All the time, Never, Everyone, Always)
Observed behaviour that is not directly related to the story currently under consideration or being discussed during development
Consider using the Shared experience exercise to ittlustrate the value of good stories.

Story mapping
What is it?
All the stories (or known / unknown things), just arranged in a shape that tells the bigger story.

Why?
Show the vision, problem, solution and roadmap - Helps to form a shared understanding get consensus with your team and stakeholders.

How?
Structure shows the decomposition of big stories into smaller stories.

Show the size, complexity, dependencies, what we know, what we don’t know and even show progress.
