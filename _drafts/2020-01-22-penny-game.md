Description
The Penny game is a classic exercise to show the difference between traditional Waterfall and Agile and introduce the concept of small batch size and continuous delivery.

Goal
This exercise is designed to allow participants to experience and reflect on how batch size and continuous flow/delivery can lead to Value being delivered earlier, less risk and overall faster delivery. The exercise compares the differences between traditional Waterfall and Agile. 

Waterfall = Big batch, staged movement throughout value stream

Agile = Small batch, continuous movement/flow throughout value stream

Learning Objective
Impact of Small vs Large batch sizes
Experience continuous delivery vs staged delivery
Experience constraints on value stream

Materials you'll need
Depending on group size 20 pennies/coins per group (When you have a high volume of groups, experiment with giving some groups consistently sized coins and others differently sized groups to illustrate that variability in story size can have an effect)

2x paper squares per team, one labelled 'Backlog' and the other labelled 'Value delivered'

1x large sheet of paper to record the teams timings (Maybe two - three of these depending on how many groups you have)

Post-its (Of course) to actually record the timings so you can reuse the large sheet of paper

Table / flat service for each team to use (they will line up against it)


Preparation
Work out and plan your group numbers.
A group needs between 4-6 'Workers' however each group needs the same number to make it fair. 
A group needs one 'Customer' - if you have odd numbers, assign people to be the Customer for up to two groups.
If you are limited on numbers, you could just have one team with one customer and X workers - you can still land the same message, but it helps the atmosphere when there's a competition, also you'll see a consistency in the results which you can call out as proof of the learning.
Divide your coins into equal amounts - recommended 20 coins
Create your 'Backlog' and 'Value delivered' placeholders
Prep your score sheet - see example table below (Use the Post-its!)


Iteration 1	Iteration 2	Iteration 3
Team #1	Time to first value (coins)	


Total time for all value (coins)	




Team #2	Time to first value (coins)	


Total time for all value (coins)	




How to run the exercise
Set the stage
Form the teams
Ask them to spead out in a line against the table, ask the Customer to stand at one end
Hand the 'Value delivered' placeholder to the Customer
Hand out the Coins and the 'Backlog' placeholder to the person at the opposite end
The objective of the exercise is to get the coins from Backlog, through each member of the team, to 'Value delivered' 
Each Coin represents a single feature, story or piece of value
The Customer's role is to
Record the time it takes until the first piece of value is realised i.e. a coin touches the 'Value delivered' placeholder
Record the time it takes until all the value is realised i.e. all coins are resting on the 'Value delivered' placeholder
Make sure each coin is flipped (See below).
The Customer does not touch or pass the coins.
The Workers role is to pass the coins to the person next to them, and for the last person to place them into the 'Value delivered' placeholder. 
The Workers add value/process the coins by fliping them over before passing them to the next person.
There is no timelimit - the clock stops when all the coins are resting on the 'Value delivered' placeholder.
Optional twist - If you want to be particularily challenging, you can ask that they only use their left hand to process the coins (Representing a constraint that you can remove in a 4th round)


Round 1 - Waterfall
The first round will represent a waterfall process with large batch size per handoff

All coins need to be processed in full before being passed to the next person. In other words the batch size is all the coins.

Tell the teams to "Go..." and start the clock
Stop the clock when all teams coins are resting in the 'Value delivered' placeholder.
Ask the customer of each team to read out the Time to first value (when the first coin hit the 'Value delivered' placeholder) and the Total time for all value (when all coins are resting on the 'Value delivered' placeholder) - Note: the two times maybe identical, that's expected.
Ask how this felt when they were processing the coins (and everyone else was waiting), ask how it felt when not processing the coins etc. Make the comparisons with the Waterfall process 'Gather requirements, define requirements, analyse, design, build, test' etc


Round 2 - Smaller batch size
The second round will use a much smaller batch size, 5 coins per batch. 

All the same rules apply, the only difference is that the coins can be passed to the next person in batches of 5.

The smaller batch size is comparable to Scrum.

Similar steps to before
Tell the teams to "Go..." and start the clock
Stop the clock when all teams coins are resting in the 'Value delivered' placeholder.
Ask the customer of each team to read out the Time to first value (when the first coin hit the 'Value delivered' placeholder) and the Total time for all value (when all coins are resting on the 'Value delivered' placeholder) - Note: the two times will nolonger be identical, you'll have delivered value much earlier and you'll 'usually' see a significant decrease in the total time.
Ask how this felt this time around. Any different? Why? Make the comparisons with the Scrum process.




Round 3 - Single (Smallest) batch size
The third round will use the smallest batch size, 1 coins per batch. 

All the same rules apply, the only difference is that the coins can be passed to the next person in batches of 1.

The smallest batch size is comparable to KanBan.

Similar steps to before
Tell the teams to "Go..." and start the clock
Stop the clock when all teams coins are resting in the 'Value delivered' placeholder.
Ask the customer of each team to read out the Time to first value (when the first coin hit the 'Value delivered' placeholder) and the Total time for all value (when all coins are resting on the 'Value delivered' placeholder) - Again, you'll have delivered value much earlier and you'll again see a significant decrease in the total time (Usually).
Ask how this felt this time around. Any different? Why? Make the comparisons with KanBan.
Which round felt the best?

Make a point about a feedback loop - what would happen if the customer decided they didn't like what they got when they first recieved the value? What about a scenario where we found a bug? Compare the first round to the second and third. Which is less risky? Which would allow us to change the product, or reprioritise the work based on new information?
