One principle that I've found useful is the metaphor of the 'milkshake test'. It asks the question: imagine you have a chain like McDonalds, and you want to sell milkshakes, what are the criteria for their successful sale?

Usually people think things like the flavor, consistency, quality of ingredients, etc are important considerations. And while the milkshake does need to meet some minimum threshold here (needs to be cold, sweet, viscous) the most important criteria is actually that it fits into a car's cupholder. If it doesn't fit into a car cupholder, lots of people are going to be very angry and the shakes won't sell.

So the Milkshake Test represents the idea that the success criteria for the thing you're building may have little relationship to the intrinsic qualities of the thing itself. It is an encouragement to focus on how something will be used and its interactions as much or more than the thing itself. 

I see the need for milkshake thinking all the time. At ThoughtWorks we really pride ourselves on the intrinsic quality of what we're building, sometimes at the expense of the bigger picture, and sometimes we build really high quality software that just isn't strategically very useful.
