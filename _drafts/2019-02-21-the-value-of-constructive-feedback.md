There are three parts to this session to discuss the value of constructive feedback. A short exercise to get people warmed up, a presentation/discussion on giving/feedback and a suggested activity to sign up people to having regular feedback sessions.

## Materials
* 15-20 balls or scrunched up balls of paper
* A bucket or some other largish container
* A blindfold of some sort
* Screen and device for the presentation slides


## How to run the exercise
Introduce the session and objective to discuss the value of constructive feedback, get some hints and tips and finally to kickstart feedback as a regular activity. 

* Ask everyone in the room - "Who here would like to receive feedback? Hands-up" and "Who here is nervous to give feedback? Hands-up”.
Tell the room the aim of this game is to get 5 balls into the bucket.

* Ask for one volunteer, send them out of the room

### Round 1
Whilst the volunteer is outside of the room, tell everyone else that when the volunteer comes back in they need to cheer wildly no matter what the volunteer does.

* Bring the Volunteer into the room blindfolded (Audience cheers wildly). Direct them to a relatively good distance from the bucket and hand them paper to throw.

* Audience cheers wildly even when they completely miss the bucket.

* At the end ask the volunteer how they feel? (Audience cheers wildly)

* Also ask how well did you do? (Audience cheers wildly)

* Send them out again (still with blindfold on)

### Round 2
This time tell the audience to criticise, jeer and boo

* Repeat steps from previous round

### Round 3
For the final round, tell the audience “this time please give calm constructive feedback”

* Repeat steps from previous round

### Wrap-up the warmup exercise

* Thank the volunteer for their help

* Now ask everyone what do you take from that exercise?

A* sk the volunteer how did they feel in each round

### Presentation about feedback

Move onto the presentation...

Feedback: Information used as a basis for improvement. Patterns for giving effective feedback.

### Close the session
To close the session, you could include this suggested activity to sign up people to having regular feedback sessions.

* Ask people if they think that Feedback is something they want to do/work on as a team? Do they want to sign up to having regular informal feedback sessions with other members of the team?

* If they do, suggest putting everyone's name into a hat, mix them up and everyone takes out a name.

* The action is to setup a 30 mins feedback chat with the person whose name you pulled out within the next two weeks. In theory, each person will therefore have two people to give and receive feedback with. If there’s an odd number, see if anyone would like an extra session.

* Add this as a regular retro activity to setup feedback partners for the following two weeks. Use the team feedback matrix to find new partners.

* Sometimes people say “...but we don’t work that closely together so how can I give feedback?”. Well, this is an opportunity to get to know each other a bit more, about your different roles, and how you could work with each other more in future. You can still share what you’re working on and get some advice. You can still observe each other in ceremonies such as standups, retros, planning etc.
