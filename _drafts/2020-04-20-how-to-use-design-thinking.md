description: What is design thinking and how do I do it?
---

For a while design thinking puzzled me, it was around 2015, there seemed to be wave of agencies promoting Design Thinking as a capability and I'd read lots of articles describing the methodology of understanding users and their problems, ideating potential solutions to solve the problems, creating lowfi prototypes, testing the prototypes with users to get feedback. Reading this I'd wonder "but I'm already doing this, what's missing?". I was already using Design Thinking but without the label. 

Design thinking has been around a lot longer than 2015, people have been using Design Thinking and it's human centered design practices it's practice since the 1970s but the term Design Thinking is often credited to David Kelly and Tim Brown of IDEO fame who coined the term in the 1990s. 

Design Thinking is an approach and methodology, it's a hands on and user centric way of solving problems.

Design thinking is not linear. You may find out things later in the process, that you didn't know at the beginning, so you repeat or jump back to another part of the process.

Design thinking is not fixed. there are plenty
It maps perfectly to the double diamond





It's an iterative process, all about gaining a better understanding of the user and their problem

An important principle of Design Thinking is Co-designing - to solve problems we need to involve a mix of talents and the end users

It lowers risk as it has a test and learn processes


Step 1 - Understand
You start by trying to understand the problem you are trying to solve and emphasising with the users, this may be done by research, going out to observe and talk to users 

What works well is equally important

You also want to talk people who have knowledge in this area.

Research methods


Get all your assumptions out, you'll want to remove these later 

Define - Combine all your research to clearly define what your best understanding is of the problem, the users and their needs.

Synthesise your information into digestible insights (create an insight space on your wall)

Write up your problem statements

Lastly, write up questions you want to anser

Step 2 - Explore
Ideate - Generate as many ideas and options to solve the problem(s)

What are all the different ways that you could solve the problem? 

Document your ideas, not just the ones you already think as contenders. Having a list on ideas that are discounted is also useful 

Prototype - Create inexpensive, low fidelity versions of the solution using paper
Sketch the UI if it has a frontend
Sketch the experience if it's a service.

So how would I do this in practice?

Here's my guide on doing this acticity

INSERT HOW MIGHT WE, CRAZY EIGHTS etc

Protoypes value is to get feedback, share them with team members, with users and with friendly stakeholders. Prototypes can either be accepted, improved or rejected. 

Step 3 - Materialise
Test your ideas with your users

Design thinking is not linear so testnig might reveal additional understanding of the context problem to solve or users

Use your findings to refine your prototype and your next move.

Design thinking maps perfectly to the double diamond

Thinking out at the define stage - Uncovering information about the problem and your users
Thinking in at the define stage - prioritising and refining and selecting the problem the problem to be solved

Thinking out at the framing stage - generating potenial solutions
Thinking in at the framing stage - Prioritising and selecting solutions

Implementing - going into the inception and delivery phases


Principles

Team approach - promoting and taking advantage of diversity of thought
Solving real problems - The best inspiration for ideation is a pressing and urgent need
Exploring many ideas - divergent thinknig
Lightweight prototypes
Test, tes, test

Design Thinking is an iterative process in which we seek to understand the user, challenge assumptions, and redefine problems in an attempt to identify alternative strategies and solutions that might not be instantly apparent with our initial level of understanding. At the same time, Design Thinking provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. It is a way of thinking and working as well as a collection of hands-on methods.

Design Thinking revolves around a deep interest in developing an understanding of the people for whom weâ€™re designing the products or services. It helps us observe and develop empathy with the target user. Design Thinking helps us in the process of questioning: questioning the problem, questioning the assumptions, and questioning the implications. Design Thinking is extremely useful in tackling problems that are ill-defined or unknown, by re-framing the problem in human-centric ways, creating many ideas in brainstorming sessions, and adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing. Design Thinking also involves ongoing experimentation: sketching, prototyping, testing, and trying out concepts and ideas.
