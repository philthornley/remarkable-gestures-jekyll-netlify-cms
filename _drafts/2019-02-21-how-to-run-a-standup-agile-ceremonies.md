A standup is a daily meeting that the entire team attends. The purpose of a standup is to radiate relevant information throughout the team, and the reason it is called a "standup" is that everyone "stands up" for the meeting.

A standup should be:

* Short (between 1-10mins. Even for large teams, keep them less than 10-15mins)
* Informative (Just enough info that we know where work is at and if anyone needs help or support)
* Held everyday at the same time
* Walk the wall. Start at the far right (Has anything moved? Anything been stationary for a while?) and work your way to the left. We prioritise talking about the work, not each person.



> Pro tip: Use markers to denote that something has moved since the last standup (In the example above, this is what the green squares denote)

After you’ve walked the wall, have a quick whip round of updates on anything else.

## A standup update is:

* Tied to a specific card or other action
* About the state of the story, not the things you've done
* Of general interest to the group
* An opportunity to flag if you need help or something is blocking you
Short

## A common structure to an update is:

* What I did yesterday
* What I’m going to do today
* Raise any obstacles getting in the way or if I need help

What’s important to stress is that the ‘What I did yesterday’ and ‘What I’m going to do today’ are not detailed breakdowns. They are really short, succinct and only information that is important to hear. I like to think of it as speaking on behalf of the story itself. What would the story say about it’s progression across the board?

The two way conversation in a Standup is minimal and very transactional. We don’t discuss in a great amount of detail, it’s limited to ‘I need help’, ‘I can help you with that’ or ‘Hey, we need to have a conversation about that’ which is held after the standup (in the after party - more on that later)

## A response is:

* Is short
* Highlights the need for a conversation - Have this after the standup
* Does not contain a solution
* Happens after the person has completed their update.

## Optional things to do after a standup...

### Hold an After-party
Often you’ll find that people want to have a conversation about a particular story. Rather than having the conversation during standup (taking time away from everyone), call out ‘hey, we need a conversation about it after standup’. Whoever is hosting the standup takes a note of the conversation title (and who should be involved). Immediately following standup, the facilitator will quickly call out what conversations need to be had and whoever is needed stays behind.

### Have a Dev huddle
Basically the same thing as the above, but usually just between the Dev/QAs about the tech approach of a particular story / problem. It’s a good opportunity for the Devs to quickly support each other on the stories in flight.

### Research, design and analysis standup
BA’s, PO’s and XD’s etc are often working at various levels within a value stream (often on stuff that’s not a story inflight) and it’s a common trap for people playing these roles to feel undervalued in the Standup (their work doesn’t always have the daily progressional feel and focus of stories going from dev to release).

A recommendation is to have a seperate ‘Research, design and analysis standup’ after the core team standup where the roles work as a team on the varying stages if ‘readiness’. 
Focus on how we collectively assess, validate and prepare the work to the stage of story readiness. This standup is most effective when held in front of the teams storymap.



## Notes for the standup facilitator

* Keep the conversation moving. If a debate starts, call out that there’s a need for a afterparty topic and standups are not the time to debate (reaffirming the standup discipline).
* Record the afterparty topic on a post-it, also note any key people, stick it on the board and move the conversation on.
* Pro-tip - have a designated space on the wall to collect the afterparty topics - people can then also populate it 5 mins before stand-up and call it out in the standup.
* At the end of stand-up, call out the afterparty topics and who is needed. and close the standup. Often they will need to be sequenced for efficiency i.e. to minimise the amount of time people need to stick around, for example, if more people are needed for one topic, do this first so that people can then get on with their day earlier.

Over time, as the team become more disciplined, the need for a facilitator will disappear.
