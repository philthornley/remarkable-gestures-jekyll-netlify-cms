Description & Goal
Use a stakeholder map & communications plan to...

Understand who's who in your world - We know who our supporters and collaborators are.
Understand their interests and motivations
Be clear about who makes what decision
Setup the right cadence and channels for communication
This is an essential exercise for any team, usually you'd do the mapping when the team forms as a one off exercise (on the basis that your stakeholders don't change regularly change) and maintain. The communications plan should be assessed frequently, as a suggestion at the beginning of each iteration/sprint during planning  ('What do we need to communicate about the weeks ahead?', 'Who's impacted', 'who do we need support from'). 



Materials you'll need
Lots of Post-its (suggest to use multiple colours for different types of stakeholders)
Sharpies
Large sheets of paper (optional - so you can take it away with you)


Preparation
Set up your walls as follows.

Stakeholder map - Understand where they are and where you need them to be...




Communications plan







Use the tools in the PDF below.







How to run the exercise
Introduce the goal of the session

Ask everyone to write down as many stakeholders, collaborators and supporters as they can. You can do this as a group exercise. Shout out names and record them on post-its.

Give some suggestions to help nudge people's thoughts to think deep and wide and beyond the obvious (who are also important), ask people not to filter. Who might have an interest in our product? Who might we need some support from? For example...

People in other delivery teams
Security liaison
Policy liaison
Portfolio manager
Operations
Suppliers
Architecture
Steering groups
Once you've captured them, start to place them onto the Stakeholder map...



Talk about why you've placed them where you have. 

Talk about where you'd like to move them. How would you do this?

Talk about the map quadrants and what they could help us decide (interms of activity and approach), for example...

High touch
Focus here, engage and consult frequently. Tailor your communication to their interests and channel preference.

Meet needs
Understand their values and interest areas. Ensure you engage & consult on these. Try to increase their interest and engagement.

Keep informed
Keep informed and engaged on interest area. How can they help influence others? For example, they might not have the ability to directly impact your project, but they may have good relationships with those that can.

Basic communication
Use existing channels, communicate monthly or as needed. Identify those who you may need support from and aim to increase their interest and engagement.



Starting with the names in the top right, then top left, then bottom right and finally bottom left, start to form your comms plan using the template below...



WHO?

Name and role/group

CURRENT STATE

Current level of engagement

GOAL

Where do we want them to be?

WHAT?

What are they interested in? What decisions do they make? What do we want to communicate?

HOW?

What methods and channels will we use to communicate?

WHEN?

How often should we be communicating?

OWNER?

Is there a specific owner who will set it up and run with it?

LAST ENGAGED




This last activity will help you form an actionable plan and this is what you should review frequently, particularily the final column - ‘Last engaged’, it’s easy to let things slip. Fill this in when you revisit the plan and you’ll quickly surface when a stakeholder needs re-engaging. 
Final steps
The Influence/Interest activity is a 'in the room' activity only to get everyone on the same page as to where people are at, you can destroy this artifact after creating your Comms plan.

The Comms plan is the artifact to keep and maintain. Write it up digitally for easy maintenance and publish/share it. (You may want to keep the 'Current state' as a 'in the room' activity only and omit it from your digital document).

Recommendation - Go and talk to your stakeholders, especially those in the High touch/Meet needs category and validate that What, How and When information is correct. Make it an open conversation, 'I want to learn from you about how we can engage and keep you informed about your interests...'
