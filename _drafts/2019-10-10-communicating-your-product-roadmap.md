strapline: timelines and delivery cadence often lead to very different challenges and pressures.

Are you looking for a way to visualize digitally? My 2¬¢ from a product perspective, I find it isn't easy to present one visualization on its own to communicate everything you're trying to say and not create more and more questions around timelines etc., plus I think presenting a highly-polished visual works against what you're trying to achieve to not overly formalize delivery cadence, feature commitments, and timeframe. Also, a view to every feature possible alone won't necessarily help pull the team(s) together in delivering a valuable product and solid experience. 

I love what you're saying about communicating vision and creating a North Star. What I've done in the past is shift the conversation away from a feature-mindset and move towards (value-based) outcomes and capabilities. And rather than trying to visualize all the features that might exist in the end product, think of all the things you might want the product to do/enable. Under each capability/outcome you can have both aspirational as well as committed features, without having to over-commit to specific deliverables or timelines. Additionally, you want your client to get used to roadmapping not as an artifact, but rather a habit of constant discovery, communication, and collaboration activities. I typically build a physical Radar board of features (usually grouped into capabilities by colour) showing Now, Next, Later to radiate to stakeholders what we're working on, what we're exploring to possibly pick up next, and what is still way out on the horizon. Post-its can easily move in and out of phases. Features in "Later" are big and fuzzy and really poorly defined (more aspirational) and features in "Now" are better sliced, clear, and broken down into stories in our backlog/card wall. I'll pair this with a Hill Chart for what we're working on and what we're figuring out. And of course I have a Design/Analysis Board and our Card Wall for the team. I'll walk the stakeholders through this every sprint (or at whatever cadence makes sense) and I'll work with my client pair and team to make sure this is kept up-to date and informs our discovery. Also, what ends up happening, and maybe I'm going too deep into this now, is I'll have a Presentation of the defined "Now" work as an artifact... not because I love making presentations (I don't), but because clients understand presentations and you can better articulate what the team is working on and both what the work is and what it isn't.

Anyway, I don't know if I've helped here. But I thought it was worth sharing how, on a constantly evolving product, I go about communicating what matters most and what we should all be working towards at the moment and why, ensuring that we're discovering and working on things that all tie together to deliver value. Again, for me, it's typically been about a process and an ecosystem of tools and activities. Hopefully, this will inspire something that will work for you, your team, and your product person.

One of the things that I've heard stated recently* is that there is no right or wrong in how to structure a product roadmap. It's all about creating a plan that communicates the right level of detailed information for what you are trying to achieve. In other words, it depends.

Perhaps this is a slightly different example, but I thought of it only because this might be a very quick, lightweight way for you to mockup a ‚ÄúBirdseye view‚Äù of the product/product roadmap like you‚Äôre describing. It‚Äôs not as pretty as your example, but it gets the jobs done! The example below is tied to timelines, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be - here it just serves the function the company chose to communicate, namely having a public roadmap. You could swap dates out for a different organizing principle, like: products, apps, Jobs To Be Done, users, services, epics, etc. (Apologies for the yellow highlighting on some words - I posted this example elsewhere and can‚Äôt figure out how to unhighlight the copied text on my phone mail app ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.)

The roadmap comes from a company called Front that has made their product roadmap public on Trello. It is complete with images, comments, and dates. This "public-roadmap-on-trello" approach serves multiple functions, including showing and tracking their historical feature releases, transparency with what they are working on now and in the future, and the ability for users to comment and vote up or down product features they want and value.

Here's the board. Pretty awesome to scroll through.

And here's an article from them explaining why they did it.
