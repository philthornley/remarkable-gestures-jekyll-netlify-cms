Here's an analogy to help get the point across

##Digging up the road to replace the water pipes

"Oh look, that electrical pipe could be replaced too"

"Oh and they don't have fibre optic cables, lets do that whilst we've got the road dug up"

Whilst it's tempting, it's not the core focus. And we need to focus on our core deliverables
