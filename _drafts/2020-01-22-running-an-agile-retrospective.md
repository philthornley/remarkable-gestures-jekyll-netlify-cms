The Retrospective is one of the most important activities that a team will do. It's the opportunity to reflect on the last iteration (usually between one - two weeks) to learn about what went well, could be better and any puzzles the team may have. Most importantly the team will decide what we’ll do differently next time (Inspect + Adapt).

There are many different ways of running a retro, we'll cover one, but it's recommended that you experiment with different formats and focus areas (See suggested links at the end of this document)

Materials you'll need
Post-its (Lots of)
Pens
Treats


Preparation
Find a room with plenty of space, natural light and comfy chairs

Create the following headings on Post-its

Timeline
Happiness
Safety 
Appreciations
Went well
Not so well
Puzzles / Things to improve
Actions
Stick the above headings on the wall

Write down or have access to the Prime Directive

Distribute a good amount of Post-its and pens around the room so people have easy access to them

It's recommend that you spend a minimum of one hour on your Retrospective.



How to run the session
The first rule is to bring treats and make it a relaxed environment

Timeline
As people are coming in and getting settled, ask the people who look ready to call out things for the Timeline. This is a 'what's happened reminder', have there been any key events, meetings, stories played, people joining/leaving etc - you're just going to use this as a reminder, to frame the timeline, it's easy to forget things and this may jog someones memory about what worked, didn't work etc.

Spend 2mins collecting these, just enough to jog peoples memory.

Do a Happiness and Safety check
This is a anonymous score where people rate their 'Happiness in the team' and 'level of Safety to talk here and now'. Ask people to write their scores on individual stickies and fold them twice.

5 = Super happy in the team / Super safe to talk now

1 = Not happy in the team / Not feeling safe to talk

Pro tip - make it anonymous as you can, give each person the same two colours, one for happiness and one for safety and the same pen - don't start opening them until everyone has added them.

With these scores you can get a feel for how people are feeling.

If you get a few low scores in the safety check, carry on but make sure to call out that some folks are not willing to talk about all topics and to have this in mind throughout the session. The facilitator should opt to not ask everyone’s opinion during the discussion as you may put these people on the spot.

You could also choose to use the remaining time to run an activity suggest ideas to increase the group safety level.

If the majority of the safety scores are low - close the retro and setup some 121s so that people can start to talk about things in private.

Read the Prime Directive
Read this word for word, it's an important reminder of the culture we're trying to foster and to not turn the suggestion into a blame exercise.

"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."





Post-it note exercise & Group themes
Ask everyone to write down their points and add them to the buckets, give them 5 mins...

Went well
Not so well
Puzzles / Things to improve
And don't forget to encourage people to call out any 'Appreciations' they have for other members of the team. 

When everyone has finished writing, ask people to group them.

Ask the people who did the groupings to call out any key themes stickies, you're just trying to orientate people about what's there, ready for the next step. Warning - close down any discussion that occurs, remind people that their opportunity to discuss is coming up.

3 dot vote to filter which topics to discuss
Give people 3 votes to use on the themes / stickies.

They can choose whether to use their votes on just one sticky or to spread them about, it's up to them.

When everyone has voted, total up the votes and then start with discussions with the topic with the most votes.

We suggest that you agree a discussion/topic timebox, roughly 5 minutes, and that at the end of this time, you will make a concious decision whether to carry on for another 3-5mins or move on. Having this as a dicipline helps to question the value and move stuff on when we're not heading to a close and makes sure that we don't get lost on one topic.

As a facilitator, listen out for anything that sounds like a decision, next step or action. If one doesn't naturally occur, ask the group what the next action should be. Record it and get owners.



Wrap up and next steps
At the end of the session, spend 5mins going through the actions, owners and agree what you'll take into the next sprint.

Take a photo of the wall (this is your low admin hack for taking minutes) and take the action stickies and place them on your squad wall as a reminder for every standup - Have we moved on this?

Pro tip - treat your actions as a story and add it to the current iteration backlog - it's still work! This way, you make dedicated time for them and you get the same update "We're working on it, we're blocked, we're done!" etc.





Doing the same retro time after time can loose it's effectiveness
Think about how you could alternate with an different format/focus every so often. There are many different options. 

Focus on a particular area/topic

Use the Agile Teams Improvement Framework - an alternative retro to assess, explore or refine
