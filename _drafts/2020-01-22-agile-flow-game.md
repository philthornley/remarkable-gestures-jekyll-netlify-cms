Description
This exercise aims to allow a group of people working as a team to understand the process flow of taking stories from backlog to production, continuously.

Goal
This exercise is designed to allow participants to experience and reflect on working as a squad. Looking to identify bottlenecks and how people can work collaboratively to resolve them. Loosely based on moving stories from a backlog through development and testing to a ready for sign-off state

Learning Objective
Experience managing flow of stories through a value stream
Experience how things can happen that disrupts the flow
Experience bottle necks and how to deal with them


Materials you'll need
16 (or more) coloured ‘story’ cards
7 yellow column headings, Backlog, In Analysis, Ready for Dev, In Dev, Ready for QA, In QA, Ready for Sign off
6 team member cards
3 arrow cards with dice numbers on each.
1 x Whiteboard and marker pen
3 x 5 different coloured dice


Preparation
Lay the cards out on a table as per the photo below.
Set up the whiteboard as per the photo below.
To start with put 4 dice of one colour (these will represent the developers), plus 1 dice of 2 (for the BA and QA) different colours in a cup in the middle of the cards. These correspond to 1 BA, 4 developers and 1 QA people in the team. Put the others to one side.




How to run the exercise
Stage 1
Works best with teams of 5 or 6 people. Mix up the levels of experience and skills in the team e.g. mixture of QA, Dev, BA, DM, PO etc
Each white card / space in the analysis, development and QA columns represents a person in the team who can do work.
The orange cards are “stories” that the team can pick up and progress to completion.
Explain the different stages within the value stream. Stories flow from backlog through the analysis, development and QA stages to the final stage of Ready for Sign Off.
The number of stories that make it to Ready for Sign off will be recorded on the whiteboard for each day completed.
At the start of the timebox the BA can take a story in.
Each subsequent day begins with a Stand up, in which the previous days progress will be checked by rolling the dice. Story progression is given by the values on the dice. Each dice represents each person
The BA will complete and pass a story to the next stage only if the BA dice is 1,2,3,4 or 5
The Developers will complete a story and pass it to the next stage only if the dice that represents that person is a 1,2,3 or 4.
The QA will complete a story and pass it to the next stage only if the QA dice is 1,2 or 3.
Stories will sit in the “Ready for….” columns if there is no available space for it to go to.
Don’t move any other stories until the next stand up.
Facilitator to shout out “it’s Stand up time”.

Roll the dice and get the team to move any cards from the backlog, ready for dev, ready for QA into the white skill placeholder, based on the results

Check if any cards have made it into the Ready for Sign Off column, if so record the number on the whiteboard.



Observation from stage 1
Stories should start flow through the value stream i.e. across the wall. Bottlenecks should now start to appear in the “Ready for….” columns as each stand up progresses. This may take a number of days to fully emerge. Once they do you can move to Stage 2



Stage 2
Stop the exercise and ask the Team what they think is going on. Why have we got bottlenecks?

The team may have pushed more work (stories / cards) through the start of the process then they can progress in parallel through to the end.
You may need to suggest this is an issue.
Once the team have identified a number of issues, ask them how they might want to address them and resolve the bottleneck.
They may want to move people from one role to another i.e swarm.
Allow them to do this. If they do then you’ll need to amend the number of each coloured dice to reflect the new team make up.
Once the changes have been made reset to Day 1 and the start again roll the dice and see if the change impacted the flow of work and prevented the issues occurring.


Observation from stage 2
Stories should flow more effectively through the value stream but may still occur. If they do you can move on to Stage 3.



Stage 3
Stop the exercise and ask the Team what they think is going on. Why have we got bottlenecks, how could they improve the flow?

The probability of moving stories through is weighted to slow down at each column.
Ask what the team can do to change the chance of successful progression.
This might be investing in smaller stories, TDD or Test Automation for example. This would increase the probability of completion at Dev and QA, so allow the team to change the accepted values of each dice that would allow a story to progress.
Agile Values & Principles
Working collaboratively as a team, swarm when necessary
Constantly swarming is not sustainable in the long run as a way to fix underlying issues and if a team is doing this it should be challenged.
Can the team Self Organise
Can the team Inspect and adapt process and flow
Can the team identify Bottlenecks causes - entry and exit
How can you manage flow better within your squad?
Delivery Value quickly
Communication
Sustainable Pace
Control the flow of work better
Pulling stories, not Pushing and collective responsibility
