It's easy to get excited about an idea, it may feel right but before you take that leap of faith ask these four questions.

1. Do customers recognise that they have the problem you are trying to solve?
Go find out, ask them about their problems.
2. If there was a solution would they buy it? 
Find out if they are already buying it or looking to source it?
3. Would they buy it from us?
Trial it. Make it available in some form.
4. Can we build a solution for that problem?
