strapline: Before you take that leap of faith ask these 4 questions
---
It's easy to get excited about an idea, it may feel right but before you take that leap of faith ask these four questions.

1. <p><span class="bold">Do customers recognise that they have the problem you are trying to solve?</span>
Go find out, ask them about their problems.</p>
2. <p><span class="bold">If there was a solution would they buy it</span>
Find out if they are already buying it or trying to source it.</p>
3. <p><span class="bold">Would they buy it from us?</span>
Trial it. Make it available in some form.</p>
4. <p><span class="bold">Can we build a solution for that problem?</span> Investigate if you can build and support a solution. Check if it makes sense commercially - will it have the impact you want to achieve at a viable cost.</p>
