## Description
This exercise gets a group of people to prioritise, plan and sequence the delivery of a bunch of features.

## Goal
It demonstrates how you can make more informed decisions when you have good information on story value, dependencies, story size and team velocity. The game is purposefully abstract to shift focus from the detail and onto the conversation and the team approach to the task

## Learning objectives
Importance of knowing the team velocity and amending story intake for holidays etc
Experience of managing dependencies
Experience of slicing (concept of delivering parts of features in iterations based on value)
Experience of prioritising for value delivery and cost of delay
Experience of managing impact of new incoming work


## Material
4 x Iteration cards
5 x feature set cards
5 x unplanned cards
2 x value and dependency cards instruction cards
(See photos of example assets towards the end of the document)

## Preparation
Split up into small teams
Lay out the iteration / sprint cards in front of the team


## How to play
Set the stage for round one
Split up into small teams. Mix up the levels of experience and skills in the team e.g. mixture of QA, Dev, BA, DM, PO etc
Lay out the iteration / sprint cards in front of the team (#1 to #4)
Give them the deck of stories (as a pile will do)
Explain that each card is a story and the number on the card represents the story size
The collection of coloured stories represents a full feature (i.e. you need to complete all stories to deliver the whole feature)
The numbers on the iteration / sprint cards represents the expected velocity. Notice how on the second iteration / sprint the number is reduced, explain that you know someone will be on holiday/training so the expected velocity has been reduced
Tell them to ignore the other symbols on the cards - they’re not important yet
Task - “I want you to deliver as many full features as you can, you have 2 minutes - Go”
Listen to their conversations and take notes


Example of round 1: 4 features delivered in 4 interactions (note there is no one correct approach, the value is teasing out the thought process)





## Debrief from Round one
Round one is focused on establishing the mechanics of the game but also to prompt some analytical thinking about what they choose to deliver given the known constraints

Ask how many teams delivered a feature in iteration/sprint #1, then iteration/sprint #2 etc

(It is possible to deliver a feature in every iteration/sprint)

Do they try to deliver a feature at the earliest opportunity? (so far we have not included value so it’s assumed they’re all equally valuable). Message = aim to deliver value as early as possible, one strategy is to deliver the smallest possible feature first, imagine that you could then start to get feedback and a possible return (talk about cost of delay)

Do they try to deliver the biggest feature first? Whilst some might see this as a suboptimal approach, use this as a talking point about a valid strategy of tackling the scariest/risky/complex thing first to learn the most early i.e. you may find that it’s beneficial to start here so that there are no nasty surprises later and you have to pivot late / rework all the previous work.

Do they sequence the stories to complete one feature, then another etc or do they break them up and tactically starting multiple features (playing the numbers game) together? Ask about how the team might feel with both of these approaches. Talk about the impact on the team of doing the latter - context switching, not having the satisfaction of focus and completing.



## Set the stage for round two (Dependencies)
Now introduce the dependency card and tell the team that the symbols in the bottom left hand corner of the feature cards show the dependencies across the feature.

Cards with the same letter can be played together, but the cards with a letter that comes higher up the alphabet must be played before the other e.g. L letter card must be played before a M card. The dependencies are only within the coloured feature. Note: Make it clear that there is no dependency between letters that are not next to each other in the alphabet e.g. L + S = no dependency
Task - “I want you to deliver as many full features as you can adhering to the dependencies. You have 2 minutes. Go”
Listen to their conversations and take notes




## Debrief from Round two (Dependencies)
Round two is focused on planning how to deliver features when they have dependencies between the feature cards. it will prompt some analytical thinking about what they work on first and the sequencing given the known constraints

Ask how many teams how they felt about this round? Was it harder to plan?

(It is possible to deliver all the features they had in round 1)

Do they try to deliver a feature at the earliest opportunity given they had dependencies? Message = aim to deliver value as early as possible, one strategy is to deliver the smallest possible feature first, imagine that you could then start to get feedback and a possible return (talk about cost of delay)

Do they sequence the stories to complete one feature, then another etc or do they break them up and did the dependencies make this harder whilst having to keep to the iteration velocity. Ask about how the team might feel with both of these approaches. Talk about the impact on the team of doing the latter - context switching, not having the satisfaction of focus and completing.



## Set the stage for round three (Value & Dependencies)
Now introduce the value card, tell the team that the symbols in the bottom right hand corner of the feature cards show the value of each card and when added up gives the total value of the feature delivered.
Task - “I want you to deliver as much value as you can (Dependencies still apply) - Go”
Listen to their conversations and take notes




## Debrief from Round three (Value & Dependencies)
Round three is focused on planning how to deliver features that deliver the most value (taking the dependencies into consideration). It will prompt some analytical thinking about which features they will work on first (highest value) and delivering as many high value features as they can.

How many pounds did they deliver?
Ask how many teams how they felt about this round?
Was it harder to plan?
Did they change which features they delivered first?
Do they try to deliver a feature that was the highest value first? Message = aim to deliver value as early as possible

Do they sequence the stories to complete one feature, then another etc or do they break them up? Not all features/slices are of equal value.

Look out for teams that deliver a slice over multiple sprints e.g. one card in the first sprint and then the final card in the last sprint (just to reach capacity) - ask them how motivated the team might be about working on something in piecemeal chunks. Rather than just filling the capacity, maybe they could invest the spare points/time to break down some of the big stories e.g. 5 into smaller less risky stories.



## Set the stage for round four (Unplanned)
The teams have arranged their sprint plans around value and dependencies. Now give each team a pack of Unplanned cards.
Tell them that each card is a separate/independent feature and that they have been given to the team by a very important Stakeholder
Task - “Same rules apply, decide what you want to do/change - Go”
Dependencies still apply
Listen to their conversations and take notes


## Debrief from Round four (Unplanned)
Round four brings up the likely event that Stakeholders will ask for more and come forward with new asks. Sometimes the value of the new work will be higher, sometimes lower, sometimes unknown.

What did they do? Did they deliver more or less value?

Did they completely re-plan all their work to accommodate all the new cards regardless of the reduction in value? Did they play any cards with no value? If so, explore why? Do they shy away from difficult conversations or feel uncomfortable saying ‘No - because...’. Talk about how stakeholders might not always know the impact and value of other work, how your team has this expertise to identify this, and bringing this information into the conversation will help gain a shared understanding about why you might not be able to deliver the work. Show them the ripple effect of decisions. It's not only the immediate impact but the opportunity cost (cost of not doing other work).

Did they leave everything the same? Some teams find that their current plan delivers the most amount of value and changing things would decrease the overall value. Ask them about the conversation they’d have.

Did they swap out equal value or were willing to negotiate? It should be a two way conversation and negotiation. Could there be an exchange of value. Can the sponsor help you either prioritise between two equal value items or help have the conversation with another stakeholder on the exchange?



## Close the exercise
Talk about how using this planning model they would be able to have better conversations with stakeholders, showing them the value, opportunity cost and the potential ripple effect of changes (some good, some not so good) and how you’d then need to have other conversations about the changes to other backlog items. Most stakeholders won’t be aware of the ripple effect of some of their asks. Using this model, you can easily show them.
If you have a stories broken down, sized, know the basic dependencies, you know the Value relative to each other (very important), you have a velocity (based on previous sprints) then it’s easy to plan many sprints ahead, create alignment for the team (where we’re heading and what we’ll be working on) and set expectations for stakeholders. Even taking into account the likely event of people being away from the team becomes a straightforward process to planning.
It's all easy right? The planning is, but there is work to get the value and size. Hard work, but worth all the effort.


## Applying this to your own team
Planning for real work should be no different than the above exercise. How? Build your story map (all the things you anticipate doing/achieveing) and understand any dependencies, run an estimation session to size them, assess the value of the stories and prioritise them. Hold your planning session, create iteration headings, get your team calendar and work out the expected velocity for each iteration. Then line up your stories under the sprints. Lastly, make it visible in your team area and walk your stakeholders through it. Update it as you gain new infomation.
